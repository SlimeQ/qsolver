TODO LIST:

set up makefiles for the basic structure
write a basic quadratic solver
add unit tests
	mock objects
add documentation and doc generation (doxygen?)
write spikes
	- experiment with IEEE floating point standards
		infinites
		machine epsilon <--- find this
		what if you pass NAN to sqrt?
		documentation for standard
	- try different square root functions
		make our own?
	- try different quadratic equation functions
modularlize the main program into subsections (like io)
README files
separate functions into seperate files
	input
	output
	discriminant
