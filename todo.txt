TODO LIST:

experiment with IEEE floating point standards
	infinites
	machine epsilon <--- find this
	what if you pass NAN to sqrt?
	documentation for standard
set up makefiles for the basic structure
write a basic quadratic solver
add unit tests
	mock objects
add documentation and doc generation (doxygen?)
add spikes
	test different sqrt functions
		make our own?
README files
separate functions into seperate files
	input
	output
	discriminant

TODO LIST:
write spikes
- experiment with IEEE floating point standards
- try different square root functions
- try different quadratic equation functions
- modularlize the main program into subsections (like io)
set up makefiles for the basic structure
