TODO LIST:

write spikes
 - experiment with IEEE floating point standards
 - try different square root functions
 - try different quadratic equation functions
 - modularlize the main program into subsections (like io)
set up makefiles for the basic structure
write a basic quadratic solver
add unit tests
add documentation and doc generation (doxygen?)
